# PrevalenceMetaR
This repository provides a CSV data file and an R script for meta-analysis of single proportions using the meta package. It covers effect size pooling via GLMM, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias detection. Users can input their data into the CSV or modify the script for custom headers.
